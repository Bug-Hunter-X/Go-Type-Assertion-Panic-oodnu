# Go Type Assertion Panic

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: panicking due to a failed type assertion.

## Bug Description

The provided Go code attempts type assertions without proper error handling. If the `interface{}` variable does not hold the expected type, the program panics.

## Solution

The solution involves using type switches or checking the type before performing the assertion to prevent panics and handle different data types gracefully.
